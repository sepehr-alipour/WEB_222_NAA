          Around the world Eagles have been famous for their power and North American people named
          them as a bird of prey. Also in the past the pictures of eagles stamp on coins and golds
          that was national symboled of some countries. They categorized in the hunting birds
          species and there are 60 birds of this species in eagle category. For recognizing males
          and females of eagles you can find out that females are 25% larger than males. The bald
          eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor (accipitrid) in North
          America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the California condor (Gymnogyps
          californianus), a New World vulture which today is not generally considered a taxonomic
          ally of true accipitrids. However, the golden eagle, averaging 4.18 kg (9.2 lb) and 63
          cm (25 in) in wing chord length in its American race (Aquila chrysaetos canadensis), is
          merely 455 g (1.003 lb) lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean
          wing chord length by around 3 cm (1.2 in).
