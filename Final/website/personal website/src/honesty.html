            Around the world Eagles have been famous for their power and North American people named
            them as a bird of prey. Also in the past the pictures of eagles stamp on coins and golds
            that was national symboled of some countries. They categorized in the hunting birds
            species and there are 60 birds of this species in eagle category. For recognizing males
            and females of eagles you can find out that females are 25% larger than males. The bald
            eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor (accipitrid) in North
            America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the California condor (Gymnogyps
            californianus), a New World vulture which today is not generally considered a taxonomic
            ally of true accipitrids. However, the golden eagle, averaging 4.18 kg (9.2 lb) and 63
            cm (25 in) in wing chord length in its American race (Aquila chrysaetos canadensis), is
            merely 455 g (1.003 lb) lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean
            wing chord length by around 3 cm (1.2 in).
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, the bald eagle's close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but
            shorter-tailed white-tailed eagle and the overall larger Steller's sea eagle (Haliaeetus
            pelagicus), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia The call consists of weak
            staccato, chirping whistles, kleek kik ik ik ik, somewhat similar in cadence to a gull's
            call. The calls of young birds tend to be more harsh and shrill than those of adults. he
            bald eagle is placed in the genus Haliaeetus (sea eagles), and gets both its common and
            specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adult's head. Bald in
            the English name is from the older usage meaning "white" rather than "hairless",
            referring to the white head and tail feathers and their contrast with the darker body,
            as in piebald.
          </p>
          <p>There are two recognized subspecies of bald eagle:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              H. l. leucocephalus (Linnaeus, 1766) is the nominate subspecies. It is found in the
              southern United States and Baja California Peninsula.
            </li>
            <li>
              H. l. washingtoniensis (Audubon, 1827), synonym H. l. alascanus Townsend, 1897, the
              northern subspecies, is larger than southern nominate leucocephalus. It is found in
              the northern United States, Canada and Alaska
            </li>
          </ul>

            The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of Canada,
            all of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle
            endemic to North America and the Americas in general. Occupying varied habitats from the
            bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec
            and New England, northern birds are migratory, while southern birds are resident,
            remaining on their breeding territory all year.

            The bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of American
            wetland habitat such as seacoasts, rivers, large lakes or marshes or other large bodies
            of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of
            water with a circumference greater than 11 km (7 mi), and lakes with an area greater
            than 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are optimal for breeding bald eagles
          </p>
          <p>
            The bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great
            variety of prey. Throughout their range, fish often comprise the majority of the eagle's
            diet. In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet
            of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. More than 400 species are
            known to be included in the bald eagle's prey spectrum, far more than its ecological
            equivalent in the Old World, the white-tailed eagle, is known to take. Despite its
            considerably lower population, the bald eagle may come in second amongst all North
            American accipitrids, slightly behind only the red-tailed hawk, in number of prey
            species recorded.
          </p>

          <p>
            In December 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed quadrupling the number of
            bald eagles that can be killed by the wind electric generation industry without paying a
            penalty to 4,200 per year. If issued, the permits would last 30 years, six times the
            current 5-year permits.
